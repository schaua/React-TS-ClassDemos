Create a C# restful web api that provides CRUD operations for managing Scientist data including name, imageid, field, birthdate, deathdate (optional) and country of origin.  The API should allow a client to get a list of the current Scientists, get an idividual Scientist, edit the data for an individual Scientist, create a new entry and delete an idividual Scientist.  On the backend the app should use PostgreSQL database for persistence.
